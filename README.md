## Short Descreption of Assignment 4:
The ICP 4 is about data manipulation and Linear Regression. Data manipulation involves processing and transforming raw data to make it suitable for analysis. It includes cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data into a desired format. While Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Short Descreption of Assignment 8:
The Assignment 8 is about implementing a hidden layer to autoencoder and prediction on the test data and then visualize one of the reconstructed version of that test data.
Also, visualize the same test data before reconstruction using Matplotlib on autoencoder and denoising autoencoder and also plotting loss and accuracy.
